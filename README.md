# Nand to Tetris

Look how far we've come technologically, marvelous. Through the course nand2tetris
I seek understanding of computers from bare metal to applications we run.

Here, I document, or perhaps provide, my creations and solutions along the way. As
a free spirit, I partially comply with the provided specifications leading
a few creative outbursts as I wish to make this experience personal especially for
the Jack compiler and the language itself.
